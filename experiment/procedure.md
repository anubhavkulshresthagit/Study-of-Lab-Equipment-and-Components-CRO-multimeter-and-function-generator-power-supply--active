## These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator :-

This Simulator is designed to study various Lab equipment and Components, like CRO, function generator, Multimeter, and power supply- active, passive components, and breadboard.

Step 1:- When the user visits the simulator it will interact with the first page, on top "Aim" will be displayed and below it, There are three-tab will be shown in which a short description of each simulator is placed.

Step 2:- Bottom of each tab a "Go" button will be displayed which will take you to the respective simulator.

Step 3:- When the user clicks on any of them, then redirect to the respective simulator.

<b> Step 3:-  Multimeter Simulator:- </b> 

Step 3.1:- After the landing on this simulator (Multimeter), the user interacts with the page and some animation to understand the multimeter.

Step 3.2:- Left of the page some instruction will be displayed and right of the page a dummy image of the multimeter will be shown, and bottom of the page there are some components which will be tested afterward.

Step 3.3:- User is experimenting as per as given instruction, the value of each component will be display on the screen of the multimeter after experimenting.

Step 3.4:- As per the given instruction user select any components from the given bottom tray.

Step 3.5:- Drag the "Red" pin to the positive side and the "Black"  pin to the negative side.

Step 3.6:- Click on proceed button then the result is shown on the screen on the simulator.

<b> Step 4:-  CRO and Function generator Simulator:- </b>

Step 4.1:- In this Simulator user can visualize how waveform depends on the frequency and its amplitude.

Step 4.2:- On the left side there are two panels first one function Generator and the second one for instruction, using the function generator user can select the type of wave after that user will have to select frequency and amplitude and go with a run.

Step 4.3:- On the right side the dummy image of CRO is displaced and the user can easily be viewed the wave on-screen on CRO.

Step 4.4:- When the user hover on the dummy image of CRO user can easily see its function.

Step 4.5:- Firstly, the user has to select the type of wave which the user wants to be generated.

Step 4.6:- After selecting the type, set the amplitude and frequency of the wave.

Step 4.7:- Click on the "RUN" button, which is provided at the bottom of the CRO screen.

<b> Step 5:-  Active and Passive components and breadboard. </b>

Step 5.1:- When the user enters this page they saw three panels first one for Active components, the Second for Passive components, and the third for Breadboard.

Step 5.2:- User can get far better information regarding elements with corresponding examples.

Step 5.3:- User can click on any of the given examples to get to know more about them.
