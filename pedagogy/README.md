#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce Theoretical Concept

By this experiment we want students to understand about some Lab Equipments and components i.e.. CRO, Multimeter, Function generator, Active and Passive componets. By performing this experiment they would themselves analyze the working of all components, how wave is generated in CRO, its dependencies on amplitude and frequency, how multimeter test any components, basic difference between active and passive components.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Describe the generation of periodic wave (square, sin, cos) in CRO with the help of Function generator. | Remember | Describe
2.| User will be able to: <br>Describe the concepet of Active and Passive components with help of several examples. | Understand | Describe
3.| User will be able to: <br>To learn how to use a multimeter to read current, voltage and resistance. | Understand | Apply
4.| User will be able to: <br>Analyze the working and how all these Equipments are beneficial in respective area. | Analyse | Analyze

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Problem Based
###### Assessment Method: Summative

<u> <b>Description: </b></u>
<br>
** Multimeter **:- Students can select any components and then drag positive pin to positive side and negative pin to negative side as well then after click on proceed they can clearly see the result which is displayed on screen of multimeter, user can use back button to to take back step.<br>
** CRO and Function generator **:- Firstly students have to start the function generator by clicking start button placed left of function generator. Students can select any type of wave which they want to  make afterwards set the appropriate value of amplitude and frequency then click on Run then students can clearly see the curve on CRO. <br>
** Active and Passive components **:- Students can understand the concept of active and passive component with the help of several examples.<br>
Scope: Various runs of the same experiment are possible, so that user may completely learn the objectives.
